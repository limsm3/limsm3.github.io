### My story
I am interested in Mechanics of elastic structures, Machine learning and Robotics in general for my studies. 
I collect aircraft photos for fun. Enjoy outdoor stuff. 
Texas roadhouse is the greatest invention.
This blog is built for the record of my book readings and critical reviews on them.
