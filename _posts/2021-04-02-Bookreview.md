subtitle: Perspective as a researcher

This is the first book review for 2021. I picked up this book in a used book store in Koreatown, Los Angeles. The only reason I picked up the book is due to its Korean translated title, "유혹하는 글쓰기", which means enticing writing.

I used to read a lot when I was a kid. I would finish reading it on the spot for the books I have bought regardless of how long it would take for me. I liked experiencing the world written inside a book. However, since high school, I was busy taking care of other businesses and let reading fall off my hand. The writing was just a task for me to finish work.
On the other hand, I have records of bits and pieces of my journal for the days when I was stressed or under intense emotional pressure. I always had this eagerness to share what I am feeling with others but I also knew that the others are too busy living their own life. Writing a journal and reading again was one way to share my feelings in a view of the others. Maybe I had this sporadic habit of writing throughout my life, even without realizing how important it is, but there must be some connection with the reason I picked up this book from the bookstore. 

2021, I am an apprentice, learning how to conduct scientific research and write scientific reports, which means writing is a significant portion of my job. It makes sense for me to spend time on writing and learning how to write. This book helped me reconsider some of my attitudes towards writing and research. Some of his words are essential for researchers as well. To list a few,

- The editor is always right
- Your job isn't to find these ideas but to recognize them when they show up
- I think I was forty before I realized that almost every writer of fiction and poetry who has ever published a line has been accused by someone of wasting his or her God-given talent. If you write (or paint or dance or sculpt or sing, I suppose), someone will try to make you feel lousy about it, that's all. 

Humans desire recognition and acknowledgment from others. We fear evaluation and judged based on many things. Stephen shares his experiences that only when you are diligent, the muse will come. Small success leads to others, but there is always someone who will try to make you feel lousy about your work. These lessons are the main lessons I learned even though writing techniques were written in this book also. 

I would evaluate this book to be a great book to start 2021 for me—also, a good book for fellow researchers like me who is looking to improve. I will continue my book review with the books that Stephen recommends on his book list. I hope I feel embarrassed when I look back at this two years later and more confident about the writing skills and research.
