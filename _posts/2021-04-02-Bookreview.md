This is a first book review for 2021. I picked up this book in an used book store in Koreatown, Los Angeles. The only reason I picked up the book is due to its Korean translated title, "유혹하는 글쓰기", which means enticing writing.

I used to read a lot when I was a kid. For the books I have bought, I would finish reading it on the spot regardless of how long it would take for me. I simply liked experiencing the world written inside a book. However, since high school, I was busy taking care of other businesses and let reading fall off my hand. Writing was just a task for me to finish work. On the other hand, I have records of bits and pieces of my journal for the days when I was stressed or under intense emotional pressure. I always had this eager to share what I am feeling with the others but I also knew that the others are too busy living their own life. Writing a journal and reading again was one way to share my feelings in a view of the others. Maybe I had this sporadic habit of writing throughout my life even without me realizing how important it is, but there must be some connection with the reason I picked up this book from the bookstore. 

I am an apperentice learning how to conduct scientific research and write scientific reports, which means writing is a big portion of my job also.
